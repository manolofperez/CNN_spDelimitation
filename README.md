# CNN_spDelimitation_Piloso
scripts from Perez et al. "Species Delimitation Meets Deep Learning: Insights from a Highly Fragmented Cactus System",
used to compare models of species delimitation with both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Scripts and notebooks are presented for the Pilosocereus and Drosophila datasets,
and each folder contains a README file explaining its contents.

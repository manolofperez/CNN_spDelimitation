# CNN_spDelimitation_Piloso
scripts from Perez et al. 2021 "Coalescent-based species delimitation meets deep learning: Insights from a highly fragmented cactus system" (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13534),
used to compare models of species delimitation with both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Scripts and notebooks are presented for the *Pilosocereus* and *Drosophila* datasets,
and each folder contains a README file explaining its contents.

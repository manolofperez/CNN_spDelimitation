# ***Pilosocereus aurisetus* CNN scripts and data**
Piloso_simulate_ms_CNN.py - python script to simulate segregating sites and save them as NumPy arrays
for the *P. aurisetus* dataset.

trainingSims - Folder containing the simulated data for each model to train the network, 
generated by running Piloso_simulate_ms_CNN.py

testSims - Folder containing the simulated data for each model for the cross-validation step, 
generated by running Piloso_simulate_ms_CNN.py. 
The simulations in this folder are similar to the ones that should be used in the training step.

CNN_Piloso.ipynb - python notebook containing code and outputs for CNN training, cross-validation 
and prediction of the most likely model using empirical data.

Trained_10KSims.acc.mod - Trained model with the *P. aurisetus* simulations.

Input_Piloso.txt - Segregating sites from the empirical dataset.
